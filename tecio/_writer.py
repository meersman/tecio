"""Shared, format-independent base class for Tecplot writers.

Every format's writer (SZL, PLT, DAT) exposes the same lifecycle: construct with a path
and optional variable list (eager or lazy open), buffer auxiliary data with
:meth:`~TecplotWriter.add_auxdataset_dict`/ :meth:`~TecplotWriter.add_auxvar_dict`,
write zones with ``write_ordered_zone``/ ``write_fe_zone``, and close (directly or via
context manager). This module defines the parts of that lifecycle that are identical
across formats once, so the three writers can no longer drift apart the way the readers
had.

Notes:
    * Unlike the reader hierarchy, writer instances are not made immutable.  A writer is
      inherently a mutable, sequentially-appended-to object (``current_zone`` grows, aux
      buffers fill and drain, a file handle opens and closes), there's no "already-read,
      now frozen" state to protect the way there was for reader Zone/Variable objects.
    * :meth:`~TecplotWriter.flush_aux` centralizes the aux-data buffer draining and key
      resolution (a 0-based int or a variable name), which was previously duplicated
      nearly verbatim in all three formats. Each format only implements the two small
      hooks that actually differ, writing one dataset-level item and one variable-level
      item.
    * ``_open``, ``close``, ``write_ordered_zone``, and ``write_fe_zone`` stay
      abstract: how a file is opened/closed and how a zone is actually written
      are genuinely format-specific (a live C handle for SZL, a global implicit
      context for PLT's classic API, a plain text file for DAT). Their
      signatures here are the common shape for documentation; Python doesn't
      enforce exact signature matching on
      ``abstractmethod``, so a format may add its own extra keyword-only parameters
      (SZL's ``flush``, for subzone flushing mid-write) without conflict.

                           ``{"x"}`` or ``[1]``. None means all active.
        var_sharing:       Variables to share from another zone: a ``{variable: source
                           zone}`` mapping, name or 0-based index to 0-based zone index,
                           e.g. ``{"x": 0}``. None or an empty mapping means no sharing.
        dataset_variables: The full dataset variable name list, already established
                           (after the writer's own lazy-open handling).
        meta:              The writer's own zone metadata, for resolving shared
                           variables' source zones.
        on_error:          Optional callback invoked once, before any ValueError is
                           raised, for a format needing extra cleanup on failure (DAT's
                           partial-file deletion; SZL/PLT need none, the C library
                           handles it, so they pass None).

    Returns:
        A :class:`PreparedOrderedZone` with everything else needed to proceed to the
        format-specific zone-creation call, or ``None`` if every dataset variable
        is passive or shared, leaving nothing to write. In the ``None`` case an
        :class:`EmptyZoneWarning` is emitted and the caller should return without
        creating a zone; ``on_error`` is not invoked since nothing has gone wrong.

    Raises:
        TypeError: *passive_vars*/*var_sharing* isn't a list/tuple/set/mapping as
            appropriate, or mixes variable names and indices.
        ValueError: On any inconsistency: wrong active-variable count, shape mismatch
            (local or shared), a shared variable referencing a zone that doesn't exist
            yet or isn't ORDERED, or a variable named in both *passive_vars* and

    Shared across formats: derives num_nodes/num_cells from node_map (or the con_sharing
    source zone), resolves value_locations/passive_vars/ var_sharing defaults, validates
    the active-variable count and every array's size (local and shared) against those
    counts, validates and derives face-neighbor state (mode, count, structural
    compatibility), and builds the dataset-level value_locations/variable_types arrays
    every format's zone-creation call needs.

    Args:
        arrays: NumPy arrays already converted from the caller's raw data, one per
            active (non-passive, non-shared) variable.
        variable_types: Per-active-variable data type, one per array in
            *arrays*. Computed by the caller (see
            :func:`prepare_ordered_zone` for why this isn't derived here).
        zone_type: This zone's :class:`~tecio.ZoneType`.
        node_map: Connectivity array, or None if *con_sharing* is set.
        value_locations: Per-active-variable value location, or None for all-NODAL.
        passive_vars: Variables to mark passive: a list, tuple, or set of variable
            names, or of 0-based indices (not a mix of both), e.g. ``{"x"}`` or
            ``[1]``. None means all active.
        var_sharing: Variables to share from another zone: a ``{variable: source zone}``
            mapping, name or 0-based index to 0-based zone index, e.g. ``{"x": 0}``.
            None or an empty mapping means no sharing.
        con_sharing: Source zone index to share connectivity from, or None for no
            sharing.
        face_neighbors: Optional flat face-neighbor connectivity array.  Left in its
            natural dtype (never forced to a particular integer width here): a writer
            needing a specific dtype for its own dispatch call (PLT's int32-only classic
            API, for instance) casts the returned array itself.
        face_neighbor_mode: Required if *face_neighbors* is given, invalid if it isn't;
            see :func:`validate_face_neighbor_sharing`.
        dataset_variables: The full dataset variable name list.
        meta: The writer's own zone metadata, for resolving shared connectivity/variable
            source zones.
        on_error: Optional callback invoked once, before any ValueError is raised, for a
            format needing extra cleanup on failure (DAT's partial-file deletion;
            SZL/PLT need none, the C library handles it, so they pass None).

        :class:`EmptyZoneWarning` is emitted and the caller should return without
        creating a zone; ``on_error`` is not invoked since nothing has gone wrong.

    Raises:
        TypeError: *passive_vars*/*var_sharing* isn't a list/tuple/set/mapping as
            appropriate, or mixes variable names and indices.
        ValueError: On any inconsistency: wrong active-variable count, array-size
            mismatch (local or shared), con_sharing/var_sharing referencing a zone that

        precision: ``None``, the enum directly, or a case-insensitive string
            (``"single"``/``"float"``/``"double"``).
        allow_none: Whether ``None`` is a valid result. SZL: yes, per-variable data type
            is inferred automatically from each array, with no file-wide override to
            normalize. PLT and DAT: no, ``precision`` must resolve to a concrete
            FLOAT/DOUBLE, but for different reasons and with different scope:

            * PLT's classic API has one ``VIsDouble`` flag for the entire file (set once
              at ``tecini142``); every variable, including integer-valued data, is
              declared and stored at that single type. There is no per-variable type in
              PLT's zone header at all.
            * DAT's ``precision`` only decides two things: the ASCII significant-digit
              count used to format floating values, and which of FLOAT/DOUBLE is
              declared for variables whose own array is itself float-typed. A variable
              inferred as an integer type keeps its own INT32/INT16/BYTE in the zone's
              ``DT=`` declaration regardless of ``precision`` (see
              :func:`~tecio._dat_write._resolve_written_type`), since that declaration
              is what Tecplot uses to allocate memory on read, not the printed digit
              count. A value can be written as ``1.000000000e0`` and still be declared
              (and read back) as an integer.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If *precision* is ``None`` and *allow_none* is False, or if it's
